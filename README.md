Authors:

Marla Anderson: mfanderson@uchicago.edu
* Wrote initial code for isograms, palindromes, and horizonal symmetry/ music notes program; typed up readme file, and edited Powerpoint

Kevin Ramirez: kevinramirez@uchicago.edu
* Wrote, debugged, and commented on initial anagram function, and edited Powerpoint, wrote code for ASCII interesting find.

Tina Tetrick: ctetrick@uchicago.edu 
* Made the majority of the Powerpoint and also merged the isogram and anagram programs so only iso-anagrams printed.

## Programs:
Anagrams: Finds and groups words longer than 7 characters from a file that share the same letters.
* TO RUN: python anagrams.py

Isograms: Finds words in a list with no more than one of each letter, and then states a total at the end.
* TO RUN: python isograms.py 

Palindromes: Lists all words spelled the same backwards as forwards from a given file.
        This will list palindromes lest than 8 characters because none above 7 exist in the given file.
* TO RUN: python palindromes.py


Horizontal Symmetry / Music Notes: Lists all word from a given file that contain only certain letters.
        By changing editing the code, you can search for different types of words. 
        For instance, to search for words that can be played on a piano, change the letters in the "horizontals" dictionary to A,B,C,D,E,F, and G
* To Run: python checkbook.py
